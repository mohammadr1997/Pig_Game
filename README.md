## 🧑‍💻 pig_Game
A very fun game you can play with your friend. The player on the left starts the game. (A black background indicates whose turn it is.)
Each player rolls a dice to accumulate points until they reach 100 to win.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points they've collected in the current turn and the turn switches.
Players can hold their score at any time to secure it before risking a 1
