very fun game you can play with your freind.player at position left start a game.(black background shows who's turn is it).each player rolls a dice until get 100 score to win, if a player rolls a dice to zero he loses all his scores and has to start again.
each player can hold his scores by tapping on the hold button. winner gets the green background.coding to create a game like this actually made me deeply apprehend all functionality of it and how to think and code to get to the final game. this project was one of the best one that I learned javascript fundamentals in practice.
I did it alone at home while I was practicing and re-learning DOM and basics in javascript.
